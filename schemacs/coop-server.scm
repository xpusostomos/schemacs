;;; Cooperative REPL server.
;;;
;;; This file is GNU Guile's `(system repl coop-server)', whole, plus a
;;; notification hook - so that a program embedding the server can be
;;; *told* that the server has work, instead of having to poll it.
;;;
;;; Two differences from upstream, and both are the point of the file:
;;;
;;;   1. The server record carries a NOTIFY procedure, given to
;;;      `spawn-coop-repl-server' with `#:notify', and
;;;      `coop-repl-server-eval' calls it after queueing an operation.
;;;      Upstream's contract - "poll-coop-repl-server be called
;;;      periodically" - is unchanged; what this adds is a way to know
;;;      *when* a poll is worth making, so that a host program with an
;;;      event loop of its own does not have to guess a period.
;;;
;;;   2. `poll-coop-repl-server' answers whether it applied anything. A
;;;      wake that is level-triggered - a byte in a pipe, an idle
;;;      source - says only "there is work", not "there is one item of
;;;      work", so a consumer has to drain the queue rather than poll it
;;;      once. Without an answer there is no way to know when to stop.
;;;
;;; The module is named `(schemacs coop-server)' rather than
;;; `(system repl coop-server)' only so that it can live in this tree
;;; without shadowing Guile's. Renaming it back is the whole of the edit
;;; needed to submit the rest as a patch.
;;;
;;; Everything else is upstream, verbatim, including the comments.

;;; Code:

  #:use-module (ice-9 match)
  #:use-module (ice-9 threads)
  #:use-module (ice-9 q)

COOP-SERVER's notify procedure, if it has one, is called afterwards, with
COOP-SERVER, once the queue's mutex has been released.

The notify procedure may be called from any thread - the thread that
accepted a connection, or the thread reading for a session - and nothing
serialises it, so two threads may call it at once. It is called *after*
the operation is on the queue and never before, which is what makes the
queue safe to poll for: a consumer whose wake is level-triggered cannot
miss an operation, because the thing it watches is not raised until the
operation is there. A consumer whose wake is edge-triggered must drain
the queue rather than poll it once - see `poll-coop-repl-server'."
