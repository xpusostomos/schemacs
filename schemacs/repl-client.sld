(define-library (schemacs repl-client)
  ;; The client half of the development back door: `se --repl[=PORT]'.
  ;;
  ;; **It starts no editor.** This is `emacsclient' the other way round -
  ;; the server side (`server.el''s `server-start', here
  ;; `schemacs/repl.sld''s `start-repl!') is what an editor opens with
  ;; `--server', and this connects to one of those and gives the terminal
  ;; back to it as a REPL. What is typed here is read and evaluated *in
  ;; the editor's process*, at the back door (`poll-repl!'), so this needs
  ;; nothing but a socket - and it deliberately does not load the editor's
  ;; libraries, so that `se --repl' cannot start an editor even by
  ;; accident.
  ;;
  ;; THE PROTOCOL is the one the cooperative REPL server speaks: a banner
  ;; and a prompt when a client arrives, and afterwards one answer per
  ;; expression. That is why the server-to-terminal direction is copied a
  ;; **character** at a time - a prompt has no newline in it, and a
  ;; line-at-a-time reader would sit on it until the next answer came.
  ;; The terminal-to-server direction is a line at a time, because that is
  ;; what a terminal hands over: it is in canonical mode and the line
  ;; arrives when RET does.
  ;;
  ;; WHERE THE PORT COMES FROM. With `--repl=PORT' it is given. Without,
  ;; it is read from the files `start-repl!' writes - the port number in
  ;; `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/schemacs-repl-<pid>.port' (or `/tmp', when
  ;; `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' is unset), newest first - which is the same
  ;; convention `tools/repl.py' reads. That convention is in three places
  ;; now (here, `repl.sld' which writes it, and the Python tool); it is
  ;; one line, and this library must not import the editor's libraries to
  ;; reach it. What it does *not* share with the Python tool is how a
  ;; candidate is accepted: that one checks the pid is alive, this one
  ;; connects and keeps the socket if it answers, which tests the thing
  ;; that actually matters.
