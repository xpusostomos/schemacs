(define-library (schemacs editor editfns)
  ;; This library mirrors GNU Emacs's `editfns.c': the primitives that
  ;; read and write *positions* in the buffer and the text between them -
  ;; `point', `point-min', `point-max', `goto-char', `insert',
  ;; `delete-region', `buffer-substring', `buffer-string', `char-after',
  ;; `bolp', `eolp', `save-excursion' - and the two that give the region
  ;; its edges.
  ;;
  ;; What is here so far is the region, because that is what is needed
  ;; now. The rest are the engine's under its own names for the moment
  ;; (`text-editor-get-cursor' is `point', `text-editor-insert' is
  ;; `insert', `text-editor-copy-string' is `buffer-substring'), because
  ;; the engine is `buffer.c' and `insdel.c' and the position arithmetic
  ;; had to live somewhere; they come here, under Emacs's names, when
  ;; something needs them by those names.
  ;;
  ;; See LAYOUT-PLAN.txt for the rule this library is a step of, and
  ;; REGION-PLAN.txt for what it is part of.
