# Makefile -- build, install and package guile-schemacs.
#
# Guile has no `guild install'.  What it does sanction is the three pieces this
# file drives:
#
#   guile-config info VAR   where Guile looks for modules
#   guild compile           how to compile one
#   guild use2dot           what a module depends on
#
#   make                    compile every module into build/
#   make test               run the test suites
#   make install            into $(PREFIX), default /usr/local, with .go files
#   make install-local      into ~/.local, sources only (Guile compiles on use)
#   make uninstall          remove what install put there
#   make clean              remove build/
#
# Both installs also put man/schemacs.1 where man(1) looks for it: PREFIX's
# share/man/man1, or ~/.local/share/man/man1.

GUILE_SITEDIR   := $(shell guile-config info sitedir)
GUILE_CCACHEDIR := $(shell guile-config info siteccachedir)

# --- install layout ---------------------------------------------------------
# DESTDIR is honoured, so a package can stage into a chroot:
#   make install DESTDIR=$(pkgdir) PREFIX=/usr
PREFIX    ?= /usr
BINDIR    ?= $(PREFIX)/bin
MANDIR    ?= $(PREFIX)/share/man
MAN1DIR   ?= $(MANDIR)/man1
SITEDIR   ?= $(PREFIX)/share/guile/site/$(EFFVER)
CCACHEDIR ?= $(PREFIX)/lib/guile/$(EFFVER)/site-ccache

# Guile's auto-compile cache lives under $XDG_CACHE_HOME when that is set and
# $HOME/.cache otherwise.  Honour the same rule it does, or the targets below
# look in a directory Guile never writes to.
CACHEHOME ?= $(if $(XDG_CACHE_HOME),$(XDG_CACHE_HOME),$(HOME)/.cache)

LOCALPREFIX  ?= $(HOME)/.local
LOCALBINDIR  ?= $(LOCALPREFIX)/bin
LOCALMANDIR  ?= $(LOCALPREFIX)/share/man
LOCALMAN1DIR ?= $(LOCALMANDIR)/man1
LOCALSITEDIR ?= $(LOCALPREFIX)/share/guile/site/$(EFFVER)

# --- the manual pages --------------------------------------------------------
# Nroff sources in man/, installed as they stand.  man-db reads an uncompressed
# page perfectly well, so nothing here depends on gzip; a packager who wants
# /usr/share/man/man1/schemacs.1.gz can gzip the installed file.
MANPAGES := $(wildcard man/*.1)

# --- what is a module and what is a script ----------------------------------
# Every .scm with a define-module is a module: it is compiled and installed
# under the site directory, its .go under the site ccache.  What is left over
# is a SCRIPT FRAGMENT -- script/prelude.scm, which the launcher LOADS before
# anything is imported.  bin/ holds launchers, installed as they stand.

DIRS    := schemacs
SCRIPTS := script/prelude.scm
MODULES := $(filter-out $(SCRIPTS),$(wildcard $(addsuffix /*.scm,$(DIRS))))
GOS     := $(patsubst %.scm,build/%.go,$(MODULES))

# What gets installed from the tree: every file under $(DIRS) except editor
# backups.  `cp -r $(DIRS)' carried foo.scm~ along with foo.scm, so whatever an
# editor left lying in the working tree ended up in the system's site directory
# -- where nothing ever removes it.  One file at a time, by name, with `find'
# rather than a wildcard so the list holds files and not directories.
SOURCES := $(shell find $(DIRS) -type f ! -name '*~')

# The prelude is compiled like everything else, but it INSTALLS differently: not
# into the site ccache, which is indexed by module name -- and a fragment has no
# module name -- but beside its own source, which is where Guile looks for a
# fragment's compiled file.  Either way `guile -l script/prelude.scm' finds it
# and skips the source: it is a fragment of nothing but `use-modules', so
# compiling it bakes in no definitions that the wrong module could capture.  (A
# `define-module' wrapper would break it: the imports would land in that module
# instead of (guile-user), the module the user's lines and scripts run in.)

# The per-file prerequisites come from Guile's own dependency tool.  They are
# conservative -- a .go is rebuilt when any module it uses changes, not only
# when a macro did -- which is the safe direction to be wrong in.  The prelude
# is asked about too, so its .go is rebuilt when a module it imports changes.

# A local install carries no .go: Guile compiles into the user's own cache the

# uninstall removes what install put there: the site tree, its ccache, the
# launcher, and the manual page.  It does NOT touch the auto-compile cache,
# which belongs to whoever
# RAN the shell -- and under sudo, $HOME and $XDG_CACHE_HOME are root's, not
# theirs, so it could not find it if it tried.  Entries left behind are keyed by
# the installed source path; they are harmless (Guile recompiles when the source
# is newer) but a user who wants them gone can remove
# $(CACHEHOME)/guile/ccache/*/usr/share/guile/site/$(EFFVER) themselves.
